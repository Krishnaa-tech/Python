### 🔍 Two Sum Problem – Efficient Python Solution 💻⚡
#### Problem Statement
You are given an array of numbers and a target sum. Your task is to find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

##### 📝 Example
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
# Output: [0, 1] (Because 2 + 7 = 9)
```

#### 🚀 Optimized Approach – Hash Map 🗂️
💡 Instead of using a brute-force approach with two loops, we can solve this problem efficiently using a hash map (dictionary).
##### 📝 Solution Code
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}  # Stores number and its index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found
```
#### 🔎 Why is this efficient? 🤔
✅ Time Complexity: O(n) – We iterate through the list once.  
✅ Space Complexity: O(n) – Stores numbers and their indices in a dictionary.
