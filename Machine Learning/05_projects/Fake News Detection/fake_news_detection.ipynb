I was sitting at the table, we had finished eating, we were now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever had. Words failing him, Trump outstretched his hands and gave an approximate size. Since he s a big boy and was behaving well at dinner, Trump got an extra bigly slice of chocolate cake. He was also quick to note that the President of China loved the chocolate cake. It s now been 30 seconds since he was asked to describe his order to attack Syria. He hadn t mentioned the country once.In fact, when Trump gets around to describing the country he just attacked he calls it Iraq.

A senior House of Representatives Republican aide said on Tuesday night no decision had been made on bringing legislation to the floor this week before the House is due to start a week-long break late on Thursday. A bill would need to be filed by late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning to hold the vote before the break.  Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus faction that helped block Trump\\u2019s first attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, said earlier on Tuesday Republicans were still \\u201ca handful of votes away.\\u201d The lack of movement among Republicans puts Trump in danger of his second major legislative setback, raising questions about his ability to secure passage of other parts of his agenda, including a major tax reform plan. Most House Freedom Caucus Republicans have gotten on board with the new proposal, but Democrats are vowing to oppose any attempt to unravel Democratic former President Barack Obama\\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul.  The latest Republican plan would allow states to opt out of Obamacare provisions that force insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same rates. That is seen as a concession to conservatives to attract their votes. Trump insisted in an interview with CBS News that aired on Sunday that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would remain. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s time now\\u201d for a healthcare vote, the Republican president said at the White House on Tuesday.   Even if a plan passes the House, it is expected to face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower majority. Republicans contend that Obama\\u2019s signature 2010 healthcare law, which allowed some 20 million Americans to gain medical insurance, is too intrusive and expensive. The White House sent Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol on Tuesday to meet Republican holdouts on the party\\u2019s latest effort to pass a healthcare overhaul. Republicans remain divided over key aspects of the healthcare bill, with some lawmakers worrying about a potential spike in the number of people without coverage, or sharp increases in insurance premiums. Representative Daniel Webster, whose central Florida district is home to many retirees, said Pence told him he would try to work out problems caused by proposed Medicaid spending caps that would limit nursing-home beds. \\u201cI just think it\\u2019s going to cost us a lot in Florida,\\u201d Webster said. Another Florida Republican, Thomas Rooney, said confusion over the potential loss of coverage for pre-existing conditions had his constituents scared that \\u201cthey\\u2019re going to die because of a vote that we might be taking.\\u201d Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action started to increase pressure on moderate Republicans who were resisting the bill, such as Representative Billy Long of  Missouri. \\u201cBilly is using liberal talking points to distort the truth,\\u201d Club for Growth President David McIntosh said, adding that Long \\u201cmay want to keep Obamacare.\\u201d Left-leaning groups, including the Center for American Progress (CAP), were pushing their members to call lawmakers to urge them to oppose the healthcare bill, including via 7,000 medicine bottles delivered to congressional districts. Emily Tisch Sussman, a CAP organizer, said those efforts had generated \\u201ctens of thousands\\u201d of phone calls. Patient advocacy groups, including the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, also oppose the reworked bill, while the American Medical Association and others have expressed concerns. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mayors from the largest U.S. cities warned President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday of the potential economic harm he might cause if he wipes out a program that allows young illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. They warned in a letter that as much as $9.9 billion in tax revenue would be lost over four years and $433.4 billion in U.S. gross domestic product would be wiped out over 10 years if he cancels a policy aimed at protecting these people from deportation. DACA, or The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, was created through an executive order in 2012. It allows undocumented young people brought to the United States before the age of 16 to remain without fear of deportation as they pursue a higher education, work or engage in  military service. The deferred action is subject to renewal every two years. The mayors asked for the program to allow for initial applications and renewals to continue until \\u201cCongress modernizes our immigration system and provides a more permanent form of relief for these individuals.\\u201d As president, Trump would have the authority to undo DACA. \\u201cThis program helps foster economic growth and enhances public safety and national security,\\u201d said the letter, written by the Democratic Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, and signed by mayors of other major U.S. cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. \\u201cWe are clear as mayors that these are dreamers who are seeking the American Dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait-and-switch,\\u201d Emanuel said after presenting Trump the letter at a meeting in New York. Trump has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, an estimated 11 million people, and promised to build a wall on the border with Mexico. According to the letter, which was made available to the press, nearly 742,000 undocumented youths have participated in DACA. DACA is part of the broader immigration issue of municipalities that offer themselves up as \\u201csanctuary cities,\\u201d where local law enforcement refuse to report to federal authorities undocumented immigrants they encounter. Trump has threatened to cut off federal funding for those municipalities. While he would have the authority to cut some kinds of funding, mayors of those cities have said they will not be pressured to report migrants to federal agents. Santa Ana city council voted on Tuesday to declare their community in Southern California of 325,000 people, half of whom are foreign born and 80 percent of Hispanic descent, a sanctuary city. In Los Angeles, the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to ask county departments to provide plans for shielding undocumented immigrants from U.S. immigration authorities, said Jessie Gomez, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Hilda Solis.  The board oversees health, law enforcement and social welfare departments that operate county-wide but it does not administer the city of Los Angeles. Nearly one million residents of Los Angeles County are believed to be undocumented immigrants, according to Solis\\u2019 office. White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Wednesday said he could not address the incoming president\\u2019s potential actions but that the current administration was working to ensure Trump\\u2019s team understood why Obama pursued the policy.  \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cThe president\\u2019s been crystal clear, both in words and deeds, about his view that young people who are American in every way but their papers shouldn\\u2019t be deported ... A policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values,\\u201d Earnest said of DACA. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

mccarthy had this to say about the lawlessness of obama s release of prisoners in making a mockery of his core constitutional duty to execute the laws faithfully the broad law enforcement discretion the constitution vests in the executive branch has been president obama s preferred sleight of hand in reality prosecutorial discretion is merely a resource allocation doctrine peculiar to criminal law a recognition of the obvious fact that enforcement resources are finite that it is neither possible nor desirable that every penal infraction be prosecuted and therefore that priorities must be established about which cases should be pursued which left to state law enforcement to handle and which overlooked the doctrine has never been what the president has turned it into a license not merely to ignore but to rewrite laws not just penal laws any laws with which he disagrees on policy grounds he s set a record with the number of releases president barack obama commuted the prison sentences of 95 people mainly for non violent drug related offenses and pardoned two others the white house said in a statement on friday obama has made reforms to the us criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non violent drug crimes one of the top priorities for his remaining year in office with the move on friday president obama who signed the fair sentencing act in 2010 has now granted 184 commutations during his time in office more than the last five presidents combined the number of sentences obama commuted friday is more than double the number he granted this summer and it s the third time this year he s given clemency the washington post reported i commuted the sentences of 95 men and women who had served their debt to society another step forward in upholding our ideals of justice and fairness obama said the fair sentencing act reduced the sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses and many of the pardoned offenders would have faced shorter penalties under today s laws each of the 95 people who received a commutation friday got a personal letter from the president he wrote i believe in your ability to prove the doubters wrong and change your life for the better ex democratic presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter reduced sentences for 90 inmates total republicans george w bush his

trump s a liar video newt gingrich was promoting his new book understanding trump on the view today the leftist hacks of the the view took advantage of his appearance to play gotcha as they attempted to find ways to coerce a confession out of newt that president trump is a liar newt wasn t falling for it however while many of us would have preferred to see gingrich take off the gloves with the hosts of the view he chose instead to sit back and sling a few arrows on an as needed basis the not funny comedian joy behar attempted to paint trump as a serial liar and was surprised when gingrich shot back with you mean like you can keep your doctor you can keep your insurance you want to talk about lies by a president behar responded by attempting to convince gingrich that barack obama didn t lie when he told one of his most famous lies to the american people and that it was simply a misjudgment on his part near the end of the interview whoopi goldberg went through a list of questions she used to vet gingrich and prove how credible he was based on his answers when the subject of the popularity of president trump came up in the discussion gingrich confessed that he was shocked at how well trump was doing considering a recent harvard study that showed 93 of the post election coverage of president trump was negative coverage whoopi appeared to be close to needing medical attention after gingrich rightfully pointed out the disgusting lopsided negative coverage that president trump s received since he was elected since goldberg had no honest rebuttal to offer she made up a whopper of a lie telling gingrich and her viewers that prior to the election 98 of candidate trump s media coverage was positive and went on to suggest that was the reason he won sorry whoopi but here are the actual facts about the percentage of negative coverage trump received from the mainstream media prior to the election from the liberal politico a whopping 91 percent of news coverage about donald trump on the three broadcast nightly newscasts over the past 12 weeks has been hostile a new study finds the study conducted by the conservative media research center found that not only has trump received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his democratic rival hillary clinton but nearly all of that coverage 91 has been hostile according to the study watch the interview here in addition the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving trump such as his treatment of women than controversies surrounding clinton such as her email practices or the clinton foundation for the study mrc analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the abc cbs and nbc evening newscasts from july 29 through october 20 including weekends of the total newscasts the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign the study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves instead focusing on what the correspondents anchors expert commentators and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire even when they were critical of hillary clinton for concealing her pneumonia for example or mischaracterizing the fbi investigation of her e mail server network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage the study found this was not the case with trump who was slammed as embodying the politics of fear or a dangerous and vulgar misogynistic bully who had insulted vast swaths of the american electorate 98 of pre election trump coverage was positive actual percentage of positive trump coverage is shocking \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
