# House Price Prediction â€“ End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow for predicting house prices based on multiple features, including the number of rooms, location indicators, and crime rates. Itâ€™s designed for **educational purposes** and is ideal for beginners learning machine learning with **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand and prepare real-world data for modeling
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build a preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-learn
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest regression model
- Save and reload a trained model
- Discuss how to improve and deploy the model

---

## What You'll Learn

- Data loading, cleaning, and exploration
- Feature scaling and missing value imputation
- Building pipelines using `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`
- Model training with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
- Saving models with `joblib`

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Dataset Used

We use the **Boston Housing dataset** for this demo. It is a well-known dataset used for regression tasks in ML.

ðŸ“Œ In a real-world setting, you can easily substitute this with:
- [Kaggle's House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Open in Google Colab
- Upload the notebook: `house_price_prediction.ipynb`
- Run all cells step-by-step

### 2. Or Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
```

---

## Sample Output

```python
Mean Squared Error: 9.81
RÂ² Score: 0.87
Prediction for sample input: $24,890.23
```
---

## Future Improvements
* Use a larger and more diverse dataset (e.g., Kaggle)

* Try different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)

* Perform hyperparameter tuning

* Add deployment with Streamlit or FastAPI

* Monitor drift and performance using MLOps tools
