# Machine Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the Machine Learning section of this repository! This roadmap is designed to take you from beginner to proficient ML practitioner using hands-on Python-based learning.

---

## Stage 1: Foundations
- [ ] Python for ML: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- [ ] Math Essentials: Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics
- [ ] Jupyter Notebooks & VS Code Setup

---

## Stage 2: Core Machine Learning
- [ ] Supervised Learning: Regression & Classification
- [ ] Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

---

## Stage 3: Deep Learning
- [ ] Basics of Neural Networks (Perceptron, Backpropagation)
- [ ] CNNs for Image Processing
- [ ] RNNs & LSTMs for Time Series / NLP

---

## Stage 4: MLOps & Deployment
- [ ] Model Versioning with DVC
- [ ] ML Pipelines (MLFlow or Kubeflow)
- [ ] Deployment: FastAPI / Flask + Docker
- [ ] Monitoring and CI/CD

---

## Stage 5: Real-World Projects
- [ ] House Price Prediction (Regression)
- [ ] Sentiment Analysis from Tweets (NLP)
- [ ] Fraud Detection System (Anomaly Detection)
